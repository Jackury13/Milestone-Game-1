# Milestone-Game-1

This is my first milestone project for the software bootcamp I am enrolled in.
This project is used to test and guage where i am at in my coding education.
To start the game, simply read the hint provided about the zombie themed word. Choose what letters you would like to guess by clicking on the keyboard provided on the screen. When the game is over you will be prompted if you survived the Zombie Horde or not.




Some source code was used in the makinng of this game. i did type everything out myself but honestly struggled with the JavaScript potion of this assignment greatly. so much so that i didnt get much styling dont to the page. which is the part I enjoy more.
